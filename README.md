# School Requisition Management System

The Online School Requisition Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of managing school requisitions, attendance, and communication among teachers, staff, supervisors, store personnel, receptionists, and principals. This system facilitates the ordering of items for student and staff use, tracks attendance, handles complaints and compliments, and ensures efficient communication within the school environment.

## Features

### 1. Order Management
- Teachers and staff can place orders for various items required for school activities.
- Supervisors can review and approve or decline the orders submitted by teachers and staff.
- If an order is approved, store personnel can issue the requested items to the respective teachers and staff.
- A receipt is generated and stored for future record-keeping.

### 2. Attendance Management
- The system allows for the recording of attendance, with homeroom teachers responsible for marking attendance.
- Teachers can easily view attendance records for their classes and track student attendance patterns.

### 3. Complaints and Compliments
- Teachers can forward complaints and compliments to the principal for timely resolution and recognition of exceptional efforts.

### 4. Parental Communication
- Receptionists can access details of absentees and contact parents to update the reasons for their absence.
- This information is made available to homeroom teachers for tracking student attendance and addressing any concerns.
